# Env-ChocV2TKL
A Compact TKL layout utilizing Choc V2s and a Elite-C

### What this is
This is an experiment/concept, Ive been wanting a choc keyboard for a while but finding keycaps for choc V1s is rather difficult. There are also almost no ISO Keycap sets that would go on a TKL HOWEVER! it appears Choc V2s are more alike cherry LP switches which fit normal MX keycaps, they have a different footprint to Choc V1s and MX style switches (which Cherry LP is also not like normal MX).

###
feel free to steal the Choc V2 footprint out of here but, I made it by modifying the choc V1 footprint and just adjusted/resized a couple bits to fit but im not wholly sure if its correct.. well it should be as per the dimentions listed by Kailh.
